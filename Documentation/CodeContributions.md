### Contribution Guide for Code

#### Share, remix, improve
The philosophy behind this project is that everything can be improved on by anyone. So for example, even if someone just committed a new class, anyone can feel free to submit a pull request that improves said class.

#### Style Guide
All code contributors should familiarize themselves with this project's [Code Style Guide.](/Documentation/CodeStyleGuide.md)

#### Backporting
One of the major goals in Limitless is to enable backporting of code to Cydia. Work has started on a [Backporting Style Guide](/Documentation/BackportingStyleGuide.md), so take a look at that if you're interested in bringing features from Limitless to Cydia, and feel free to submit a pull request to improve the guide.
