### Contribution Guide for Designers
Programmers aren't known for their good taste in design, so we welcome designers to contribute their skills to this community project.

## Share, remix, improve
The philosophy behind this project is that everything can be improved on by anyone. To enable this, we try to make source documents as accessible as possible.

#### Preferred Design Files
* #1. [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
* #2. SVG

We prefer Sketch because it's the most widely used in iOS design. Icons should be comprised of vectors, and raster images should be kept to a minimum so assets can be resized without any loss in quality.
